# myFlix - Star Wars App

## About this app:

This is a React Single Page React Application (SPA) that was built for Achievement 3 of CareerFoundry's Full-Stack Web Development Program. Achievement 2 was builiding the RESTful API, [movie_api](https://github.com/Dansprouls/movie_api) , which stores the backend data, including a list of every Star Wars movie and user who has created a profile. This is the client-side of the myFlix application which allows users to signup, login, and browse thier favorite movies from a Galaxy far, far away! Once a user is logged in, they can add movies to thier Favorite's list which is present in the Profile section of the application. There, they can also update user information, username, password, email, and birthday. User's can also find additional information on their favorite movies by navigating to the movie view. Once there, various details pertaining to the movie and director can be found. The app also has a built in feature to search for a movie by title, which will return whichever movie(s) fit the criteria. User's can also de-register their account if they wish to. This application is hosted on Netlify.
